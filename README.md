**DLOmix** is a Python framework for Deep Learning in Proteomics. Initially built on top of TensorFlow/Keras, support for PyTorch can however be integrated once the main API is established.

## Usage
Experiment a simple retention time prediction use-case using Google Colab &nbsp;&nbsp; [![Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/wilhelm-lab/dlomix/blob/develop/notebooks/Example_RTModel_Walkthrough_colab.ipynb)

A version that includes experiment tracking with [Weights and Biases](https://www.wandb.ai) is available here &nbsp;&nbsp; [![Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/wilhelm-lab/dlomix/blob/develop/notebooks/Example_RTModel_Walkthrough_colab-weights-and-biases.ipynb)

**Resources Repository**

More learning resources can be found in the [dlomix-resources](https://github.com/wilhelm-lab/dlomix-resources) repository.

## Installation

Run the following to install:
```bash
$ pip install dlomix
```

If you would like to use [Weights & Biases](wandb.ai) for experiment tracking and use the available reports for Retention Time under `/notebooks`, please install the optional `wandb` python dependency with `dlomix` by running:

```bash
$ pip install dlomix[wandb]
```

**General Overview**
-  `data`: structures for modeling the input data, processing functions, and feature extractions based on Hugging Face datasets `Dataset` and `DatasetDict`
-  `eval`: classes for evaluating models and reporting results
-  `layers`: custom layers used for building models, based on `tf.keras.layers.Layer`
-  `losses`: custom losses to be used for training with `model.fit()`
- `models`: common model architectures for the relevant use-cases based on `tf.keras.Model` to allow for using the Keras training API
-  `pipelines`: an exemplary high-level pipeline implementation
-  `reports`: classes for generating reports related to the different tasks
-  `constants.py`: constants and configuration values
-  `utils.py`: utility functions



**Use-cases**

- Retention Time Prediction:
    - a regression problem where the retention time of a peptide sequence is to be predicted.

- Fragment Ion Intensity Prediction:
    - a multi-output regression problem where the intensity values for fragment ions are predicted given a peptide sequence along with some additional features.



**To-Do**

Functionality:
- [X] integrate prosit
- [X] integrate hugging face datasets
- [X] extend data representation to include modifications
- [X] add PTM features
- [X] add residual plots to reporting, possibly other regression analysis tools
- [X] output reporting results as PDF
- [X] refactor reporting module to use W&B Report API (Retention Time)
- [ ] extend pipeline for different types of models and backbones
- [ ] extend pipeline to allow for fine-tuning with custom datasets



Package structure:

- [X] integrate `deeplc.py` into `models.py`, preferably introduce a package structure (e.g. `models.retention_time`)
- [X] add references for implemented models in the ReadMe
- [X] introduce formatting and precommit hooks
- [X] plan documentation (sphinx and readthedocs)
- [X] refactor following best practices for cleaner install


## Developing DLOmix
To install dlomix, along with the tools needed to develop and run tests, run the following command in your virtualenv:
```bash
$ pip install -e .[dev]
```
