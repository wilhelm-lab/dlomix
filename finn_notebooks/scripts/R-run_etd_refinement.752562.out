                Number of ions is the same as the loaded model supports, but the ion types are different.
                The model probably needs to be refined to achieve a better performance on these new ion types.
                

Avaliable feature extractors are (use the key of the following dict and pass it to features_to_extract in the Dataset Class):
{
   "atom_count": "Atom count of PTM.",
   "delta_mass": "Delta mass of PTM.",
   "mod_gain": "Gain of atoms due to PTM.",
   "mod_loss": "Loss of atoms due to PTM.",
   "red_smiles": "Reduced SMILES representation of PTM."
}.
When writing your own feature extractor, you can either
    (1) use the FeatureExtractor class or
    (2) write a function that can be mapped to the Hugging Face dataset.
In both cases, you can access the parsed sequence information from the dataset using the following keys, which all provide python lists:
    - _parsed_sequence: parsed sequence
    - _n_term_mods: N-terminal modifications
    - _c_term_mods: C-terminal modifications
